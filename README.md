# guess-my-number


## Overview
"Guess My Number" is a simple yet engaging number-guessing game developed as an assignment for my JavaScript course on Udemy ( by Jonas Schmedtmann ). The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range, providing instant feedback on their guesses to enhance the gaming experience.



## Features
- Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between a defined range ( 1 to 20 ) that players must guess.
- User Input: Players can input their guesses through an intuitive interface.
F- eedback Mechanism: After each guess, the game informs the player whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the number of attempts it takes for the player to guess the number, encouraging improvement and friendly competition.
- Reset Functionality: Players can easily reset the game to try again without refreshing the page.



## Technologies used
- JavaScript: The primary programming language for game logic and interactivity.
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring the game interface and styling.
- Git: Version control to manage code changes and collaboration.
